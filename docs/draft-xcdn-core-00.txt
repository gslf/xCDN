      The eXtensible Cognitive Data Notation (> xCDN_) Data Format
                        draft-xcdn-core-00

Abstract

   eXtensible Cognitive Data Notation (XCDN) is a text-based data
   interchange format structured to be both human-readable and
   machine-parsable.  It extends the cognitive model of JSON with
   native support for arbitrary-precision decimals, binary data,
   timestamps, and comments, while introducing streaming capabilities
   via whitespace-separated value sequences.

1.  Introduction

   JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC8259] has become the de facto
   standard for data interchange.  However, modern applications require
   data types that JSON does not natively support, such as dates,
   binary data, and arbitrary-precision decimals.  This often leads to
   non-standard string encoding conventions.

   XCDN addresses these limitations by providing a syntax that remains
   familiar to users of the C-family of languages while strictly
   defining parsing rules for complex scalars and supporting continuous
   streams of data.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
   in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in
   all capitals, as shown here.

3.  XCDN Structure

   An XCDN document consists of an optional prolog followed by a
   sequence of one or more values.

      document = WS? prolog? value { WS? value }* WS? EOF

   This structure allows XCDN to function both as a configuration file
   format (a single top-level object) and a log streaming format
   (multiple top-level objects separated by newlines).

4.  Values and Types

   XCDN distinguishes between generic scalars, typed literals (prefixed
   strings), and structural composites.

   4.1.  Typed Literals

   To avoid ambiguity, complex types utilize a single-character prefix
   followed by a quoted string.

   o  Decimals: d"123.45" - MUST be preserved with original precision.
   o  Binary: b"SGVsbG8=" - Base64 encoded data.
   o  DateTime: t"2025-10-05T12:00:00Z" - RFC 3339 timestamp.
   o  UUID: u"550e8400-..." - Universally Unique Identifier.

   4.2.  Comments

   XCDN supports C-style line comments (//) and block comments (/* */).
   Parsers MUST ignore comments and treat them as whitespace.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the registration of the media type
   "application/xcdn".

   Type name: application
   Subtype name: xcdn
   Required parameters: n/a
   Optional parameters: n/a
   Encoding considerations: binary
   Security considerations: See Section 6.
   Interoperability considerations:
      XCDN is not strictly compatible with JSON but maps 1:1 to the
      JSON Data Model with extended types.

6.  Security Considerations

   Parsers implementing XCDN MUST ensure that:

   1.  Arbitrary-precision decimals do not consume excessive memory.
       Limits on significant digits SHOULD be configurable.
   2.  Recursive structures (objects/arrays) are limited in depth to
       prevent stack overflow attacks.
   3.  Base64 decoding of 'b' literals is validated to prevent
       buffer overruns in native implementations.
